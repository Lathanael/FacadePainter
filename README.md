# Facade Painter

[Facade Painter]() is a mod for Minecraft. It enables the player to create painted facade blocks from the mod [Ender IO](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/ender-io) when
the machines module and thus the painter is not installed.

### Special thanks

This mod would not have been possible without the wonderful people making open source mods for me to look stuff up. I'd like to thank the following modders:

* mezz (for JEI and providing links to some implementations
* The Ender IO team (without them there would be no reason for this mod to exist)
