### Special thanks

This mod would not have been possible without the wonderful people making open source mods for me to look stuff up. I'd like to thank especially the following modders as
some of my code is based (partly copied and modified) on theirs:

* mezz (for JEI and providing links to some implementations as well as a understandable wiki with good instructions)
* The Ender IO team (without them there would be no reason for this mod to exist)
* BluSunrize and the rest of the ImmersiveEngineering team (their JEI implementation was a treat!)
* Insane96, iguana_man and Parker8283 (their server config sync implementation helped a ton)
